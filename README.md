Personal practices of The Art and Science of C

In the chapter 7, I meet some problem to use the library from this book.
This library is too old to use. You must use THINK C or Turbo C++ to run
it. So I just learn some OpenGL to build the DrawTools which behaviour
likes the "graphics.h".

You can coding with this tools easily. But you still need install some
thing —— OpenGL. I find a video about how to add OpenGL to Xcode:
