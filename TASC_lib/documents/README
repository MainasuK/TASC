The documents subdirectory contains several papers and other textual
materials about the cslib teaching libraries and the approach used in
the text "The Art and Science of C".  The current contents of the

README         This file presents an overview of the documents
               directory.

errata.txt     This file contains a list of the most important errors
               detected in the text.

changes.txt    This file lists changes in the cslib libraries in reverse
               chronological order, beginning with the most recent
               version and continuing backward to version 1.2, the first
               publicly available version.

usingc.txt     This file contains the text of the paper "Using C in CS1:
               Evaluating the Stanford experience" by Eric Roberts,
               which was presented at the 24th ACM Computer Science
               Education Conference in February 1993.  It describes the
               rationale behind the library-based approach to teaching C
               and discusses Stanford's early experience using it.

graphics.txt   This file contains the text of the paper "A C-based
               graphics library for CS1" by Eric Roberts, which has been
               submitted for publication at the 26th ACM Computer
               Science Education Conference in March 1995.  The paper
               focuses on the design of the graphics library and how it
               achieves its goals of simplicity and portability.

loopexit.txt   This file contains the text of the paper "Loop exits and
               structured programming: Reopening the debate" by Eric
               Roberts, which has been submitted for publication at the
               26th ACM Computer Science Education Conference in March
               1995.  This paper defends the position that students are
               more apt to write correct programs if they are allowed to
               exit from the interior of a loop in certain constrained
               situations.

ugradtas.txt   This file contains the text of the paper "Using
               undergraduates as teaching assistants in introductory
               programming courses: An update on the Stanford
               experience" by Eric Roberts, John Lilly, and Bryan
               Rollins, which has been submitted for publication at the
               26th ACM Computer Science Education Conference in March
               1995.  This paper discusses Stanford's use of advanced
               undergraduates to provide teaching support for the CS1
               course.
