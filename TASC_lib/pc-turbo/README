README file for the pc-turbo subdirectory

________________________________________________________________________

The pc-turbo directory contains an implementation of the cslib library
designed for use with the Turbo C++ compiler for Microsoft Windows.  The
code is identical to that in the pc-borland subdirectory.  However,
because the Turbo C++ compiler does not come with the same installation
tools, the instructions for installing the package are different.

TO INSTALL THE PC/TURBO VERSION OF THE LIBRARIES:

1.  Make sure that the Turbo C++ compiler is installed on your system.

2.  Use FTP to retrieve the file CSLIB.EXE from the pc-turbo
    subdirectory of the aw.com archive.  To retrieve the file correctly,
    you must set your FTP process to binary mode.

3.  Execute the CSLIB.EXE file by typing

         CSLIB

    at the DOS prompt.  This command constructs the complete CSLIB
    directory.

4.  Copy all of the .h files from the CSLIB directory to the INCLUDE
    directory supplied with the TURBO C compiler.  By default, this
    directory is \TCWIN\INCLUDE.

5.  If you are installing this package on a shared machine, copy the
    CSLIB.LIB library into some public directory where students can
    easily gain access to it.

USING CSLIB IN THE TURBO C++ ENVIRONMENT

To build a program using the cslib libraries, you need to make sure that
the project uses the large memory model.  To do so, pull down the
Options menu and select the "Code generation" submenu from the
"Compiler" option.  Click on the box that indicates the large model and
then click OK.

You must also add the CSLIB.LIB file to each project that you create.

The cslib directory contains the sample project HELLO.PRJ, which
executes the "Hello world" program.  This project has the correct option
settings and includes the CSLIB.LIB library.

NOTES AND DISCLAIMERS

The cslib libraries are in the public domain and may be freely copied
and distributed, although they remain under development.  No warranties
are made concerning their correctness or stability, and no user support
is guaranteed.  Bug reports and suggestions, however, are appreciated
and may be sent to
